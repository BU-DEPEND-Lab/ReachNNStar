# ReachNN*
ReachNN* is a reachability analysis approach based on Bernstein
polynomials that can verify neural-network controlled systems (NNCSs)
with a more general form of activation functions. We further explore how
the specific property, like Lipschitz constant, of the network influences the verification result and propose a new Verification-aware Knowledge
Distillation method to distill a new neural network controller that is
more verification-friendly and retain the knowledge from the orignal
neural network controller.

ReachNN* is a GPU implementation of the originally proposed ReachNN tool
and integrate the function of Verification-aware Knowledge
Distillation. Experiment results across a set of benchmarks show 7x to 422x efficiency improvement in terms of runtime

## Execution on VM

ReachNN* can be tested in [Virtual
Machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1phzVgLYzxnS03NiZI0Qbqulo1Fuhu3V4/view?usp=sharing), please download it and
import the .ova file using Oracle VM Virtual Box.

We have tested our code with RAM size 3072 MB. The tool is stored in folder ~/ReachNNStar.

In the home directory, credentials.txt includes information about user name and password. readme.pdf contains the instruction to test our tool. howto_vbox_shared_folder.txt is the instruction about file sharing between the virtual machine and your desktop. ~/ReachNNStar/checksum_result.txt is for the integrity check.

We note that since VM does not support GPU usage and has limited RAM memory, the runtime result could be different from what we report.

## Installation

Please skip this step if you are using our tool in the provided VM.

## User Manual

We provide a example usage to illustrate how to define a NNCS and run verification with ReachNN. Details are included in [ReachNNStar_Usage.pdf](https://github.com/JmfanBU/ReachNNStar/blob/master/ReachNNStar_Usage.pdf).


## Running Examples

NOTE: All the capitalized word is the input argument and has no suffix.

Please activate the python virtualenv before running any examples.

```

source ~/venv/bin/activate

```

We assume the following commands are running under ReachNNStar/ directory.

### Reachability Analysis for NNCS

#### This will replicate the experiments results from #1 to #6.

For example #1 to #5, the program will require at least 3GB RAM to run.

For example #6, the program will require at least 8GB RAM to run.

```

cd ReachNN

# example 1 to 5
./run_exp.sh

# example 6
# note that this program requires at least 8 GB RAM memory to run.
./run_tora.sh

```

The verification results will return to ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/SYSTEM.txt.

The computed flowpipes will be plotted to ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/image/SYSTEM.eps after the program is finished.

#### Run the specified NNCS
Please refer to the template in run_exp.sh

The neural network description file is in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/Bernstein_Polynomial_Approximation/nn/

The cpp file that model the system are in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/Bernstein_Polynomial_Approximation/systems/

```

# SYSTEM is the example's cpp filename and network filename; ERROR_BOUND depends on the system's sensitivity
./example.sh SYSTEM ERROR_BOUND

```

##### Checking Result

All results will be stored in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/

Check the result of SYSTEM

```

# verification result
vim SYSTEM.txt

# plotted flowpipes
gnuplot SYSTEM.plt

```

Check the figures in outputs/images/

### Verification-Aware Knowledge Distillation

#### This will replicate the after KD result in example #1, #2 and #6.

In this section, the new network will be trained given the original network in example #1, #2 and #6. Then, the new networks are fed to the reachability analysis module to obtain the new verification results.

For example #1 and #2, the program will require at least 3GB RAM to run.

For example #6, the program will require at least 8GB RAM to run.
```

cd VF_Retraining

# example 1 and 2
./run_distillation_limited_memory.sh

# example 1, 2 and 6
./run_distillation.sh

```
Please check the result in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/SYSTEM_retrained.txt and ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/images/SYSTEM_retrained.eps.

The one without the "retrained" suffix is the result of the original network.

#### Run the specified NNCS
```

cd VF_Retraining

# put the original network NETWORK_FILENAME in folder nn/
cp NETWORK_FILENAME nn/

# run KD to distill a new network
./example.sh NETWORK_FILENAME NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED ACTIVATION L_TARGET REGRESSION_ERROR_BOUND SCALAR OFFSET

```

The NETWORK_NEW_FILENAME will be shown in folder nn_retrained/.

After distillation, to rerun the reachability analysis on the new NN, execute the following commands:

```
# put the new network into reachability analysis module
cp nn_retrained/NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED ../ReachNN/Bernstein_Polynomial_Approximation/nn/

# create a new system file to redo reachability analysis
cd ../ReachNN/Bernstein_Polynomial_Approximation/systems

cp NETWORK_FILENAME.cpp NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED.cpp

vim NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED.cpp # change the network name to NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED in the cpp file and change the output file name to NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED too.

cd ../../

./example.sh NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED ERROR_BOUND

```

##### Checking Result

All results will be stored in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/Bernstein_Polynomial_Approximation/outputs/

Check the result with NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED

```

# verification result
vim NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED.txt

# plotted flowpipes
gnuplot NETWORK_FILENAME_RETRAINED.plt

```

Check the figures in outputs/images/

## Reproduce the result in Figure 1
```
cd VF_retraining

# If there is less than 8 GB memory, please run the following command
./example_usage_limited_memory.sh

# If there is at least 8GB memory, please run the following command
./example_usage.sh
```

The results will be reported in ReachNNStar/ReachNN//outputs/ with filename nn_1_relu_tanh_origin.txt and nn_1_relu_tanh_retrained.txt. The plotted flowpipes are shown in ReachNNStar/ReachNN/outputs/images/ with filename nn_1_relu_tanh_origin.eps and nn_1_relu_tanh_retrained.eps.
